A view of all IntelliTect Yammer posts that container the hashtag "#quoteboard".

## History

On one fine Monday in September, resident senior software engineer, [Kevin Bost](https://github.com/Keboo) posted the following on IntelliTect's Yammer:

> Someone needs to do something with this. I am not sure what, but it needs a large font. 
> 
> https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/search.json?search=%23quoteboard
> 
> \- Kevin

This being a list of all the Yammer posts that used the popular IntelliTect hashtag, "#quoteboard".

This post was largely ignored until several weeks later when another IntelliTect enginner, Alden Bansemer, posted a comment asking for a UI version of the API endpoint's JSON paylod:

> Wait where is the UI friendly version of this? I'd like to see some of these quotes listed out.
>
> \- Alden

[Joseph Riddle](github.com/joeriddles/), seeing this cry into the void and looking for ways to procrastinate vastly more important work, created a "slick" UI in aproximately 34 mintes (we timed it).

The live version of this project is running on GitHub pages at https://intellitect.github.io/Quoteboard/. You will need to authenticate will a valid IntelliTect Microsoft account.
