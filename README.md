## What is this?

A view of all IntelliTect Yammer posts that container the hashtag "#quoteboard".

## History

On one fine Monday in September, resident senior software engineer, [Kevin Bost](https://github.com/Keboo), posted the following on IntelliTect's Yammer:

> Someone needs to do something with this. I am not sure what, but it needs a large font. 
> 
> https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/search.json?search=%23quoteboard
> 
> \- Kevin

This being a list of all the Yammer posts that used the popular IntelliTect hashtag, "#quoteboard".

This post was largely ignored until several weeks later when another IntelliTect engineer, [Alden Bansemer](https://github.com/kNoAPP), posted a comment asking for a UI version of the API endpoint's JSON payload:

> Wait where is the UI friendly version of this? I'd like to see some of these quotes listed out.
>
> \- Alden

[Joseph Riddle](https://github.com/joeriddles/), hearing this cry into the void and looking for ways to procrastinate on vastly more important work, created a "slick" UI in approximately 34 minutes (we timed it).

The live version of this project is running on GitHub Pages at [https://intellitect.github.io/Quoteboard/](https://intellitect.github.io/Quoteboard/). You will need to authenticate with a valid IntelliTect Azure AD account.
